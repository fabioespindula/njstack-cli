# create-njstack-app

A simple CLI to scaffold my personal Next.js boilerplate.

This is **v1**, just the beginning â€” Iâ€™ll keep improving it over time.

---

## ðŸš€ What it does

This CLI quickly clones and sets up my [Next.js boilerplate](https://github.com/fabioespindula/nextjs) using:

- âœ… Next.js 15+ with App Router
- âœ… Tailwind CSS 4+
- âœ… TypeScript support
- âœ… Minimal and scalable project structure

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can run it directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx create-njstack-app
